##The Problem
We are drowning in animations. Look, just fubble your finger around on your android and watch the animations slide, burple and glob around the screen. <br>
Those little animations are nice the first five seconds, then they are just meaningless. Not all mind, animations are great in a screen for telling you where stuff went, how you get back to them and what just happened. But as so often happens with new cool things, sometimes their only justification is that it is possible to do it.

With modern hardware more and more things are possible. Which is awesome!


But it has created a situation where we keep getting new things even though they don't make sense, where the driving thing is the possability and the second the possability has been proven a reality it is abandoned and taken as canon. This in turn creates design that keeps doing weird things for no reason. The dancing baby gif's of 2016. 

Asde from that you have the problem with weaker hardware - hell or even normal hardware. Modern browsers these days are the most resource intense software we tend to have on our computers. To the point where, as webpages and web applications become more and more complex - they chugg down RAM and CPU like it's nobody's business. Even slim applications get add-ons after add-ons until the very ideal of the application is hidden behind a ton of surrounding effects that very few people use (cool as they may be). At the same time the Desktop Environment gets crazy and we are left with this massive churning mess blubbing around in the background, tiny usecases covered one after another until its a massive gordian knot of strange programming and even weirder design.

##The Suggestion
I want to design as if it was 1995. 1995 and you are sitting behind a dial-up modem. Design as if the resources available on your computer are not only slim, they are almost non-existant.
