There are so many things I haven't been able to do this year due to illness. So much lost time so many lost ideas. 

This years New Years Resolution is "Set fire to more shit" which, I know, is fairly abstract but it makes sense for me. I need to stop worrying and really just get going - set fire to some bridges behind me and sick my own ships in the harbour.

The practical goals this year:
- Workout more. I've gained a hell of a lot of weight and need to get moving more and eat less. So go gym three times a week for one hour at least as a base and walk/jog more.
- Draw every day. Every day one drawing or doodle.
- Plan in chunks. One day jobs has to be done within 24 hours. Week jobs has to be done within a week. Month jobs withing a month and only take on two Year jobs. Define job length when I start and then stick to it. 
- Set a daily routine and stick to it. Work during day time, not night.
