My name is **Jens, I'm an illustrator and designer** working in Open Source in general and KDE specifically. Up until a few years ago I worked mainly freelance doing illustration and design on demand and loving that. Then I started working at a communications bureau after which I was sponsored by Blue Systems to work full time on KDE stuff through the VDG a design group I founded within KDE as a way to focus design work, open up design work and to ensure that every could be a part of "design".

I am obsessive and with a touch of ADD to boot. The kind that get bored within seconds, and focused and fascinated with a subject at about half that time. Subjects like the nature of design, the reason why Open Source is the future and why illustrators by nature are better humans than designers (we just are).    

This blog is essentially my private notification area about things I'm working on, some things I'm interested in. As per usual it WILL contain things that neither Blue Systems, KDE, VDG or anyone else may feel like they want to be a part off in any way shape or form. It will contain political things (fair warning: I care about LGBT stuff, liberty stuff, union and socialist-lefty stuff, feminist-stuff and other "stuff" that you, or someone else may find disagreeable).  

There is a very real chance that I will post RPG things as well, so... if you read something you dont get, well then you just need to get a proper hobby. :)
