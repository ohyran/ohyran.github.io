_I thought I should start this years blogging with one subject that is very near and dear to me: the ideals of debate as a definition of truth_

<br>

##Quick Summation <br>
Debate is seen as a the discerner of truth in many organisations and groups. That two or more participants, through thorough argumentation and conflict can whittle out the truth of a subject matter. We discuss choices in email lists and on IRC. Angry academical debates about details in the vain hope that this format will somehow get us to reach God (1) but in a modern form: Truth with a capital T.

In Open Source this is taken as true and we do it soooo well. "Well" being another word for "Lengthy" and "Exhausting" 

I think that debate in its current form is nothing more Truth-creating than a trial by combat in legal affairs. Two or more people, usually the biggest bruisers out there, slam against each other until someone dies or is exhausted and give up. Then thats the Divine Truth. 

__The Problem__ is that In effect we have those most comfortable arguing, and arguing for hours, slamming arguments against others like someone trying to break down a door. Instead of cooperative efforts to solve a problem, the problem becomes complicated and unbearable by muddling the issues of "Is there a Problem?", "What defines the Problem?" and "How do we solve the Problem?". Essentially instead of solving a problem we create more problems and hope that through that insane panic something good will pop up in the other end. 

The method is really good if you are comfortable arguing in that group, if you have social clout to use and if you are obsessive enough to debate something until everyone dies of boredom (or have to go to bed). If you want to win that kind of a debate all you need to do is repeat yourself in different wording until everyone gets so angry at you that they start calling you names and are booted out of the debate (usually by well meaning people who think the "debate" is going swimmingly).

For everyone else all it means is that they will never have a say, and will never be able to get a foot in.

__The Solution__ is to break down the entire debate in its subject parts. The most relevant being the initial debate on whether there is a problem at all. It's often overlooked or excused away with "Well if someone says there is, it probably is" in some weird academical "Where there is smoke there is fire" way of handling evidence. Consider a conflict between Jill and Jack. Jill thinks things are going grand, Jack thinks Jill is mistreating or ignoring him. Now this is a conflict that cannot be resolved (or atleast in a constructive way). It can only be resolved by a third party: Snowman. Snowman steps in and looks at the situation and tries to explain why Jack thinks Jill is mean, and why Jill thinks Jack is overreacting. 

This isn't done to make Snowman a judge of what has happened or why but merely as a mediator for the most relevant bit of any debate - setting shared parameters.

Shared parameters is what the whole concepts about. When you have shared paremeters you can work together to find a solution. Without them all you have is a debate.
