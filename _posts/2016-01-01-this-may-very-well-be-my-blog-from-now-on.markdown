I've been shopping around for simple blog solutions that can fit the bill and tinypress may just be it. Some things to learn first of all (how to use Github properly is one of them I guess) and some wishes from the format (like how to edit blog appearence properly and including links) - oh and I do wish they will Open Source it and the Android application. 

But so far so good!

Lets find out... ok so that work fairly well - can I align it somehow? No...? Oh well. :)
